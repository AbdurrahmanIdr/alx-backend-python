# alx-backend-python

## Description

This repository contains various projects related to backend development using Python. Each project is designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in specific areas of backend programming, including type annotations, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By working through these projects, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply advanced Python concepts.
- Implement various backend functionalities using Python.
- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
- Utilize type annotations for better code clarity and static type checking.
- Explore and implement data structures and algorithms in Python.

## General Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
- Each file ends with a new line.
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of each project folder is mandatory.
- Code adheres to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths are verified using `wc`.
- All modules should have documentation.
- All classes should have documentation.
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation.
- Documentation is not a simple word but a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.
