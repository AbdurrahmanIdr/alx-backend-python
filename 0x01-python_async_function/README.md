# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description

This project focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using the `async` and `await` syntax. Through various tasks, you will learn how to run concurrent coroutines, manage async tasks, and utilize the `random` module for simulating delays.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use `async` and `await` syntax in Python.
- Execute an asynchronous program using `asyncio`.
- Run concurrent coroutines efficiently.
- Create and manage `asyncio` tasks.
- Use the `random` module to introduce delays.

## Requirements

- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
- All files should end with a new line.
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All modules should have documentation.
- All functions should have documentation.
